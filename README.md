# Go Game System

### Overview

This project implements a system for playing the game of Go on a 19x19 board. The system follows the basic rules of Go and employs a client-server architecture. Players can connect to the server, join games, and conduct matches. The server validates moves, facilitates communication, and supports both human and bot players.
